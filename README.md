# Business Case
· We are 4 young entrepreneurs willing to create a business from our passion: aquatics sports

·The idea is clear: offering experiences, primarily focusing on encounters with marine wildlife, especially sharks.

·Our services will include: international diving expeditions and raising awareness about the importance of preserving ocean habitats

·We are willing to create safe interactions for all: animals and people

# Project Overview 
To address the challenge of safe shark interactions, we discovered the Shark Attacks database online. We intend to utilize this resource to:
Refine our destination choices
Improve safety when engaging with various shark species
Ensure informed decision-making while prioritizing conservation efforts, recognizing that areas with higher attack rates are also critical habitats for sharks.
This approach will help us promote both safety and environmental stewardship in our activities.
